8. Authentication
=================

Great, we secured our views, but now no one can add new entries to our 
application, so the finishing touch is to implement our authentication views.

First we need to add a login form to our existing **index.mako** template::

    <%inherit file="pyramid_blogr:templates/layout.mako"/>
    <%
    from pyramid.security import authenticated_userid 
    user_id = authenticated_userid(request)
    %>
    % if user_id:
        Welcome <strong>${user_id}</strong> :: 
        <a href="${request.route_url('auth',action='out')}">Sign Out</a>
    %else:
        <form action="${request.route_url('auth',action='in')}" method="post">
        <label>User</label><input type="text" name="username">
        <label>Password</label><input type="password" name="password">
        <input type="submit" value="Sign in">
        </form>
    %endif
    
    % if paginator.items:
        ...

Now the template first check if we are logged in, if we are it greets the user, 
and presents sign-out link. Otherwise we are presented with sign-in form.

Now it's time to update our views and User model.

Lets update our model with two methods, "verify_password" to check user input 
with password associated with user instance and "by_name" that will fetch 
our user from database based on login.

We add following methods to our User class in models.py::

    @classmethod
    def by_name(cls, name):
        return DBSession.query(User).filter(User.name == name).first()
    
    def verify_password(self, password):
        return self.password == password

.. warning::
    In a real application verify_password should be using some strong way 
    one-way hashing algorithm like bcrypt or pbkdf2. Use a package like 
    **cryptacular** to provide strong hashing.

The final step is to update the view that handles authentication.

First we need to add following import to views.py::

    from pyramid.security import remember, forget        

Those functions will return headers used to set our AuthTkt cookie 
(from AuthTktAuthenticationPolicy) for users browser, "remember" is used to 
set the current user, "forget" is used to sign out our users.

Now we have everything ready to implement our actual view::

    @view_config(route_name='auth', match_param='action=in', renderer='string',
                 request_method='POST')
    @view_config(route_name='auth', match_param='action=out', renderer='string')
    def sign_in_out(request):
        username = request.POST.get('username')
        if username:
            user = User.by_name(username)
            if user and user.verify_password(request.POST.get('password')):
                headers = remember(request, user.name)
            else:
                headers = forget(request)
        else:
            headers = forget(request)
        return HTTPFound(location=request.route_url('home'),
                         headers=headers)

This is a very simple view that checks if database row with name supplied by 
user is present is in database, if it is a password check is performed.
If password check was successful a new set of headers used to set the cookie is 
generated and passed back to the client on redirect.
If user is not found or password doesnt match a set of headers meant to remove 
the cookie (if any) is issued.

**Voil√†!!!** 

Congratulations, this tutorial is now complete, you can now sign in and out to 
add/edit blog entries. 

Now is the time to go back to documentation to read on the details of 
functions/packages used in this example. I've barely scratched the surface of 
what is possible with Pyramid.
